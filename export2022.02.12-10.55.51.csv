However, the control performance of traditional model-based methods is limited by the parameter variations and uncertainties. Therefore, when the harmonic drive gear undergoes load torque disturbances, the underdamped vibration will be generated in the link and a steady-state error will be existed in the system. In this case, a backstepping control structure based on active disturbance rejection controller is proposed. According to the method, additional feedback of link variables is introduced by the backstepping control to improve the system damping. In the meantime, torque disturbances, parameter variations and unmodeled dynamics are integrated and observed by the extended state observers. The observation errors can be sharply decayed and converged to zero with proper poles assigned. Combined with the feedforward compensation, the steady-state error is significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the method is validated by the simulation results.","","978-1-6654-3681-6","10.1109/SCEMS52239.2021.9646148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646148","active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC);harmonic drive gears;parameter variation;torque disturbance","Vibrations;Torque;Backstepping;Uncertainty;Gears;Simulation;Drives","","","","","","13","","24 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Twice conjugated meshing (TCM) has an important influence on improving the coincidence and meshing performance of the harmonic gear transmission with double-circular-arc Common-tangent tooth profile (DCTP). A parametric design method of DCTP which can obtain continues TCM is proposed effectively. Based on the envelope theory and the deformation of flex spline (FS), the expression of the conjugate tooth profile (CTP) of the circular spline (CS) is derived. By analyzing the influence of FS parameters on CTP, the geometric relationship of CTP under TCM is found. The HD design with TCM is realized by adjusting the tooth profile parameters of FS. The calculation of error and backlash shows that the tooth profile meshes well, the backlash distribution is reasonable and verifies the geometrical property of the TCTP. The number of meshing teeth has been guaranteed.","","978-1-7281-1859-8","10.1109/IHMSC.2019.10139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8941466","Harmonic Drive;Tooth Profile Parameter;Twice Conjugated Meshing","","deformation;design engineering;drives;gears;industrial robots;splines (mathematics);splines (mechanical components)","harmonic drive;TCM;harmonic gear transmission;parametric design method;conjugate tooth profile;CTP;circular spline;twice conjugated meshing;industrial robot joints;rotation accuracy;reliability;envelope theory;flex spline deformation;HD design;backlash distribution;geometrical property;double-circular-arc common-tangent tooth profile","","","","7","","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then the active loading method by a torsion bar with double motors was used to measure the hysteresis loop. Through this test data, the model parameters were identified by the least square method, and the precision of this compliance and hysteresis model was verified through experiments.

When an external force is applied to a robot, the flex spline of harmonic drive undergoes an elastic deformation. However, such a deformation is not easy to measure by strain gauges on the flex spline because whose signals are corrupted by a periodic vibration which is “torque ripple” caused by reducing operation of the harmonic drive. We perform order analysis and design a filter to eliminate the torque ripple without using many strain gauges. As the order sampling normalizes the frequency characteristic, our method outperforms the filters with fixed cutoff frequency with manageable computational expense. Moreover, the effect of misalignment of the strain gauges is minimum unlike other methods.

Cycloid drive designs were found to be thinner, more efficient, and to have lower reflected inertia than corresponding harmonic drives. However, the cycloid designs had larger gear ratio ripple and substantial backlash, and they could not meet the maximum gear ratio provided by the corresponding harmonic drives in two out of six models for equal applied torques. Two cycloid drives were manufactured to confirm efficiency predictions and demonstrated moderate to high efficiency across a range of output torques.

To investigate elastic deformation characteristic of a flexspline under the load condition, a finite element contact analysis parametric model is established by ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL). Using this model, a spatial elastic deformation of a cup-type flexspline with any parameters can be solved. The examples indicate that elastic deformation of the flexspline has spatial characteristic, linear variation characteristic along axial direction under no-load condition, non-linear variation characteristic under load condition, and the load is heavier, the distortion (or skewness) of the flexspline is severer. By means of double cubic spline function, the deformation function with discrete data is fitted.

This is critical when the frequency of the speed variation coincides with the resonant frequency of the control system. This paper presents a speed control system to suppress the vibrations caused by the transmission error from harmonic drives. First, a new analysis scheme is proposed to analyze the effects of the transmission error. Next, a peak filter using load side acceleration information is designed and added into the servo loop in parallel with the existing controller.

Therefore, an acceleration feedback controller is especially designed to increase the damping coefficient and restrain the elastic vibration. Furthermore, the stability of the entire system including the drive joint's position controller and the acceleration feedback controller is proved using a Lyapunov approach.

The differences between the nominal model and this set are formulated as uncertainty bounds for control design purposes.

In this paper the torque control of an harmonic drive system for constrained motion is examined in detail. A nominal model for the system is obtained from experimental frequency responses of the system, and the deviation of the system from the model is encapsulated by multiplicative uncertainty.

The difference between the two torques is examined, and the contributions of the terms in the model are calculated to observe which term has the greatest effect on the difference. The model can describe the robot dynamics within about 10% for velocities higher than 1 rad/s for the shoulder joint and for the complete velocity range for the elbow joint.

Experimental observations are used to guide the development of a model to describe harmonic-drive operation. This model is able to replicate many of the features observed in actual harmonic-drive dynamic response. Valuable insights are gained about the factors which govern harmonic-drive dynamic response. Using these insights to guide the gradual development of a harmonic-drive model, the tradeoffs between model accuracy and complexity are exposed. In particular, despite careful measurement and characterization of transmission friction, compliance, and kinematic error, model performance cannot be improved without acknowledging gear-tooth rubbing losses as well. When a model incorporating gear-tooth behavior is implemented, predicted results reproduce many of the complexities of the experimental dynamic response.<<ETX>></ETX>","","0-8186-3450-2","10.1109/ROBOT.1993.291889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=291889","","Gears;Friction;Kinematics;DC motors;Solid modeling;Geometry;Harmonic analysis;Predictive models;Power system modeling;Monitoring","electric drives;friction;kinematics;variable speed gear","model complexity;harmonic drive gear transmission;dynamic models;transmission friction;compliance;kinematic error;model accuracy;gear-tooth rubbing losses","","16","1","6","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis shows that a special configuration of strain gauges on the flexspline has to be employed to eliminate errors in sensor information due to rotations of wave generators. Characteristics of the torque sensor are examined experimentally. The linearity and the dynamic response are almost the same as those of a conventional sensing technique.
