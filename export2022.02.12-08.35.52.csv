Torque ripple and misalignment torque compensation for the built-in torque sensor of harmonic drive systems,H. D. Taghirad; P. R. Belanger,"Dept. of Electr. Eng., McGill Univ., Montreal, Que., Canada; NA",IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,6 Aug 2002,1998,47,1,309,315,"A harmonic drive is a compact, lightweight, and high-ratio torque transmission device which is used in many electrically actuated robot manipulators. In this paper a built-in torque sensor for harmonic-drive systems is examined in detail. The method proposed by Hashimoto, in which strain gauges are directly mounted on the flexspline, is employed and improved in this paper. To minimize sensing inaccuracy, four Rosette strain gauges are used employing an accurate positioning method. To cancel the torque ripples, the oscillation observed on the measured torque and caused mainly by gear teeth meshing, Kalman filter estimation is used. A simple fourth-order harmonic oscillator proved to accurately model the torque ripples. Moreover, the error model is extended to incorporate any misalignment torque. By on-line implementation of the Kalman filter, it has been shown that this method is a fast and accurate way to filter torque ripples and misalignment torque. Hence, the intelligent built-in torque sensor is a viable and economical way to measure the harmonic-drive transmitted torque and to employ that for torque feedback strategies.",1557-9662,,10.1109/19.728840,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=728840,,Power harmonic filters;Capacitive sensors;Torque measurement;Intelligent sensors;Robot sensing systems;Manipulators;Sensor systems;Gears;Teeth;Oscillators,flexible manipulators;electric drives;electric actuators;torque control;torque measurement;strain gauges;position control;Kalman filters;intelligent sensors;error compensation;robust control;force feedback,built-in torque sensor;harmonic drive systems;misalignment torque compensation;torque ripple compensation;high-ratio torque transmission device;electrically actuated robot manipulators;directly mounted strain gauges;Rosette strain gauges;accurate positioning method;gear teeth meshing;Kalman filter estimation;fourth-order harmonic oscillator;error model;on-line implementation;intelligent sensor;torque feedback;flexspline,,38,,14,,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
A torque sensing technique for robots with harmonic drives,M. Hashimoto; Y. Kiyosawa; R. P. Paul,"Dept. of Mech. Eng., Kagoshima Univ., Japan; NA; NA",IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation,6 Aug 2002,1993,9,1,108,116,"The authors propose a joint torque sensing technique making use of the existing structural elasticity of robots. The technique provides joint torque sensing without reducing the stiffness of the robot or changing the mechanical structure of the joints. The elasticity of the flexsplines of the harmonic drives is utilized to measure the joint torque. The flexsplines are flexible thin cups, made from steel, in the harmonic drives that are driven by the wave generators. A finite-element analysis of the flexsplines shows that a special configuration of strain gauges, mounted on the flexspline, has to be employed to eliminate errors in sensor information due to rotation of the wave generator. Characteristics of the torque sensor are examined experimentally. The linearity and the dynamic response are almost the same as those of a conventional sensing technique. For a one-link robot arm, both theoretical and experimental investigations support the validity of the sensing technique.<<ETX>></ETX>",2374-958X,,10.1109/70.210802,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=210802,,Robot sensing systems;Elasticity;Torque control;Torque measurement;Capacitive sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Robot control;Gears;Actuators;Robotics and automation,control system analysis;drives;finite element analysis;robots;torque control,robots;harmonic drives;joint torque sensing;structural elasticity;stiffness;flexsplines;wave generators;finite-element analysis;strain gauges;linearity;dynamic response,,78,1,14,,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
