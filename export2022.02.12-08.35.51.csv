Most machine learning methods achieve good results based on the assumption of data balance. However, the scarce fault data of harmonic drive is difficult to collect, resulting in various imbalanced health status samples, which has an adverse effect on fault diagnosis. In this article, we propose a data generation method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to solve the problem of data imbalance and utilize the multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to realize the fault diagnosis of the harmonic drive. First, the data collected from three vibration acceleration sensors are preprocessed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the frequency spectrum of the vibration signal. Second, multiple GANs were adopted to generate various fault spectrum data and the data selection module (DSM) is elaborately designed to filter and purify these data. Third, the filtered generated data will be combined with the real data to form a balanced dataset, and then the MSCNN is used to achieve multiclassification of the health status of the harmonic drive. Finally, the experiments have been implemented on an industrial robot vibration test bench to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The results have shown the fault multiclassification accuracy as 98.49% under imbalanced fault data conditions, which outperforms that of the other compared methods.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2021.3089240","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Class A)(grant numbers:XDA22040203); Opening Project of National and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Industrial Friction and Lubrication Technology(grant numbers:2021-GD-0005); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515010621); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454583","Data selection module (DSM);fault diagnosis;generative adversarial network (GAN);harmonic drive;imbalanced data;multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN)","Harmonic analysis;Power harmonic filters;Fault diagnosis;Vibrations;Generative adversarial networks;Training;Splines (mathematics)","fast Fourier transforms;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;vibrations","fault diagnosis;harmonic drive;imbalanced data;generative adversarial network;data balance;scarce fault data;imbalanced health status samples;data generation method;data imbalance;multiscale convolutional neural network;fault spectrum data;data selection module;filtered generated data;industrial robot vibration test bench;fault multiclassification accuracy;imbalanced fault data conditions","","","","31","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical challenge is to justify incorporating a torque sensor in terms of cost, system complexity, and reliability. Recently, sensorless torque estimation methods have been developed for robotic joints that include harmonic drive transmissions (HDTs). The principle is based on their relatively low torsional stiffness, which allows for estimating the transmitted torque by measuring the torsional angles (via existing joint encoders) and a compliance model. However, these methods are based on nonlinear models that are difficult to identify and tune. In this study, a simplified torque estimation method is introduced based on the structural damping friction of the HDTs. The structural damping can be correlated to the HDT torque using a simplified linear dynamic model and torsional rate measurements. Experimental results have validated the proposed method, using a robotic joint setup with an external torque sensor that has been previously utilized for testing several torque estimation methods.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2021.3052392","German National Aerospace Research Program; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9326333","Robot;joint torque estimation;harmonic drive;electro-mechanical actuator","Torque;Robot sensing systems;Estimation;Strain;Generators;Damping;Torque measurement","angular measurement;damping;drives;electromechanical actuators;friction;industrial robots;torque control;torque measurement;torsion","harmonic drive based electro-mechanical actuator;torque measurements;mechatronic applications;aerospace applications;sensorless torque estimation methods;robotic joints;harmonic drive transmissions;HDT;low torsional stiffness;compliance model;nonlinear models;structural damping friction;linear dynamic model;torque sensor;torsional angles measurement","","2","","12","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To measure the external torque, we use the strain measurement of the flexspline of the harmonic drive. The flexspline of the harmonic drive is deformed by the external torque, as well as by the velocity reducing operation, which creates torque ripple on the strain signal from the flexspline. As the frequency characteristics of such torque ripple are strongly related to the joint speed, an order tracking technique is used to compensate the torque ripple. The resampling-based order tracking data acquisition is used to rearrange the torque ripple signal into the order signal, which has independent frequency characteristic to the joint speed. Then, a simple notch filter easily cancels the torque ripple from the rearranged signal. Our algorithm switches the signal source between the order tracking and the conventional time sampling to overcome the zero velocity condition. To overcome the lack of order information at low velocity, we propose a back propagation method using trained order sampling data.

However, a periodic sensing error called ripple is generated by deformation of a flexible component during the gear operation. The ripple signal cannot be sufficiently compensated by pairs of strain gages that produce opposite phase signals, because the strain gages cannot be exactly positioned on the desired locations. In this paper, we present a method to compensate the ripple by a new approach of tuning the ripple amplitudes for separate strain gages. The ripple, caused by positioning errors of the strain gages, can be perfectly compensated, and, therefore, the requirement for accurate strain gage positioning is reduced. The method does not need any online calculations, and consequently, the torque signal is not delayed.
